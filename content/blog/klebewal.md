In autumn last year, I bought a 3d printer: the [Elegoo Saturn 4 Ultra](https://us.elegoo.com/products/saturn-4-ultra-12k-10inch-monochrome-lcd-resin-3d-printer), so I'm printing all kinds of things now.
When my sister secretly confided that she wanted a tape dispenser for Christmas, I decided that I'd make a custom one for her.

{{ imgcollection(name="Fusion_KlebeWal", extension = "jpg", count = "2", first = "1", preview = "1",
        preview_alt = "Screenshot of the model in Fusion 360",
        alt=["Screenshot of the model in Fusion 360",
             "technical blueprint with front and side views and a isometric projection of an orca-whale-shaped sticky-tape dispenser"],
        classes=["clickable"]) }}

        preview_alt = "Blueprint with front and side views",
        alt=["Screenshot of the model in Fusion 360",
             "technical blueprint with front and side views and a isometric projection of an orca-whale-shaped sticky-tape dispenser"],
        classes=["clickable"]) }}

For the design, I noticed that tape dispensers somewhat look like whales and decided to make that explicit in my design. I spent an entire afternoon designing it in Fusion 360 and sent it to the printer.
These days I am using "Siraya Tech Build" resin for everyting, because I bought two liters of it.

{{ img(name="3d_print_success", extension="jpg", square=false, preview_alt="Here you see me with the freshly printed 'Klebewal', wearing scary-looking protective gear. I am giving a 'thumbs up' (the thumb looks weird, but this is no AI generated, I assure you). The objects on the buildplate are still wet and riddled with support structures.", classes=["clickable"]) }}

Only after printing it, I noticed a couple of flaws in the design, most
importantly: The tape roll was attached to ball bearings and friction was so
low, that the whole tape roll would slip upward and out when you pulled the tape.
In a subsequent print, I made the ball bearings fit inside of the tape-roll.
They are now attached to "rails" that keep the tape roll in place. An easy fix.

As you can see in the blueprint (side view), there is a box shaped opening in the bottom of the whale. This is meant to house some weight.
I bought a few bags of lead from the hardware store (they also sell fishing gear at "Hellweg" for some reason). I melted the lead with a candle and a hot air gun in a tin and poured it into a plaster cast.
In hindsight this was probably rather dangerous; If I were to do it again, I
should invest in a proper gas burner and a steel crucible with a handle. But
it worked just fine and the resulting lead block fit perfectly.

Finally, I spray painted the whale with primer followed by two coats of black paint and I added the distinctive white spots that orcas have.

I also cut a piece of felt to fit the bottom of the whale and glued it in
place with a hot glue gun.

I'm pretty happy with the result and though one could argue that the amount
of work that went into this project is seriously out of proportion for a
measly tape dispenser, I had a lot of fun doing it.
Also I am amazed how a 3d Software and -printer enables me to turn practically any idea into a physical object.

Here are some pictures of the finished product:
