I decided to move my entire Library to the "cloud" (my Synology NAS) and I like to use
Calibre to keep track of all the books I own.

I also like to use Yomu as a reader on my iPad. When I decide to read a new book,
I can download it via the OPDS format.

But how do you serve your Calibre Library as OPDS feed, such that one can access it anywhere?
I'm glad you asked: ORCA is here to help!
