Loriini is a [colorful bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loriini) -- but as of now, it is also a cli color-picker. I just wrote it in Rust.

Recently, I also added a Loriini plugin for neovim!

Here is [Loriini](https://github.com/kolja/loriini) on GitHub.

And this is the accompanying [neovim Plugin](https://github.com/kolja/loriini.nvim).

As far as I know, there is no other color-wheel style color-picker for neovim in
existence.
