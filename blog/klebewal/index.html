    <h1 class="title"> Klebewal </h1>
    <p>In autumn last year, I bought a 3d printer: the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://us.elegoo.com/products/saturn-4-ultra-12k-10inch-monochrome-lcd-resin-3d-printer">Elegoo Saturn 4 Ultra</a>, so I'm printing all kinds of things now.
When my sister secretly confided that she wanted a tape dispenser for Christmas, I decided that I'd make a custom one for her.</p>

<p>For the design, I noticed that tape dispensers somewhat look like whales and decided to make that explicit in my design. I spent an entire afternoon designing it in Fusion 360 and sent it to the printer.
These days I am using "Siraya Tech Build" resin for everyting, because I bought two liters of it.</p>

<p>Only after printing it, I noticed a couple of flaws in the design, most
importantly: The tape roll was attached to ball bearings and friction was so
low, that the whole tape roll would slip upward and out when you pulled the tape.
In a subsequent print, I made the ball bearings fit inside of the tape-roll.
They are now attached to "rails" that keep the tape roll in place. An easy fix.</p>
<p>As you can see in the blueprint (side view), there is a box shaped opening in the bottom of the whale. This is meant to house some weight.
I bought a few bags of lead from the hardware store (they also sell fishing gear at "Hellweg" for some reason). I melted the lead with a candle and a hot air gun in a tin and poured it into a plaster cast.
In hindsight this was probably rather dangerous; If I were to do it again, I
should invest in a proper gas burner and a steel crucible with a handle. But
it worked just fine and the resulting lead block fit perfectly.</p>
<p>Finally, I spray painted the whale with primer followed by two coats of black paint and I added the distinctive white spots that orcas have.</p>
<p>I also cut a piece of felt to fit the bottom of the whale and glued it in
place with a hot glue gun.</p>
<p>I'm pretty happy with the result and though one could argue that the amount
of work that went into this project is seriously out of proportion for a
measly tape dispenser, I had a lot of fun doing it.
Also I am amazed how a 3d Software and -printer enables me to turn practically any idea into a physical object.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of the finished product:</p>
