    <h1 class="title"> Feinstaub </h1>
    <p>When I must make a decision on which opinion to stand by or which political position to take, I am guided by two simple rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I think there should be as little laws and regulations as possible. The ones in place should ensure that the freedom of any citizen doesn't extend to unduly restrict everybody elses freedom (following an argument from "Four essays on liberty" by Isaiah Berlin).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When making a decision, I ask myself:
Given a perfect world, an admittedly unattainable utopia that everyone would want to live in -- would this decision bring us closer to that world or would it be a step in the wrong direction?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The other day my sister told me that she had signed a petition to abolish private fireworks on new years'.</p>
<p>If she had asked me last year I would have told her that I am against such a ban, because while I do think that fireworks are a nuissance that is dangerous, detremental to air quality and frankly an idiotic waste of money, it doesn't affect me personally to a degree that I would want to ban it for everyone.</p>
<p>In the past I have sometimes taken a stroll outside on new years eve to walk around in what feels like a warzone, whisps of smoke wallowing in the air, take in the sulfuric stench and the sound of explosions going off left and right. I'd shake my head at the people who are financing this spectacle and go back inside.
I'd shake my head again the next morning while listening to the terrible news about tragic deaths, severed limbs and injuries among the police and firemen, while wading through the debris of the night before.</p>
<p>This year, I am reevaluating my stance.</p>
<p>We had a cat over for the holiday and he feels quite safe around our flat. During the fireworks however, he went into hiding under the table. That may not be a big deal, but to me it was the straw that broke the camel's back.</p>
<p>When I think about who's rights are beeing protected here, a boy comes to mind, who had just lit a firecracker and thrown it next to a group of unsuspecting people near the subway station.
He is truely enjoying his freedom, as can be seen by the glow in his eyes and the smirk on his face.</p>
<p>Who am I to judge?</p>
<p>Yet, the adverse effects of private fireworks in public places are just to many to ignore.</p>
<p>With a ban in place:</p>
<ul>
<li>People will still be able to enjoy fireworks at a public events</li>
<li>People will still be free to burn down their own house on new years eve</li>
</ul>
<p>But the air quality will be better, pets and wildlife will be less stresed and the 'fingers per child' statistic will go up. It's a win for everyone (except that boy...).</p>
<p>Anyway: I signed the petition too.</p>
