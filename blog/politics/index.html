    <h1 class="title"> Politics </h1>
    <p>I lived in China for a couple of years and read a book or two about Chinese history.
Still, I know nothing.</p>
<p>Anyway, Here is my take:</p>
<p>Historically, Taiwan belongs to China. The reason we have the current conundrum is that, at the end of the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War">Chinese Civil War</a> in 1949, the Guomindang fled to Taiwan and the Communist Party established it's Goverment in Beijing.</p>
<p>Mainland China would have long since reunited with Taiwan if it hadn't been for US intervention.</p>
<p>In my eyes, this dosen't mean that the RPC has a right to govern Taiwan: They should acknowledge that Taiwan has a working democracy and that the Taiwaniese peoples votes should be respected.</p>
<p>Perhaps there could be a (very) long-term solution where Taiwanese vote for a government that seeks to reunite with China -- if the Chinese government was itsself a democracy.</p>
<p>I talked to many Chinese people about this, and practically everyone agrees that
a: Taiwan is "not a country", and ultimately reunification is inevitable. The Chinese leadership wants it to happen and it is more a question of timing. Certainly, China has the military means to take over Taiwan by force.
b: the PRC can not introduce democracy because it would lead to chaos ("too many people")</p>
<p>It doesn't look like a peaceful transition will happen, but there are some interesing recent developments:</p>
<p>Donald Trump is president again, and he is stupid and naive. I do not trust, that he is able to find reasonable solutions to complex problems. But he can stir up the pot and make everybody equally upset.</p>
<p>Here is the status quo:</p>
<p>Trump is threatening to impose taxes on Chinese goods. This is a bad idea, but the Chinese believe that he is unpredictable and may be serious about it. This gives him leverage.</p>
<p>Trump also had made a promise that he would immediately end the war in the Ukraine, if he was elected. He never specified how exactly he would do this, but in a recent tweet he threatened Putin with sanctions if he didn't end the war.</p>
<p>I see a unique chance for Trump to get together with Xi and "make a deal". Instead of taxes there would be a glorious economic partnership between the US and China -- as soon as China stops supporting Russia.
For China it'd be extremely easy go give Putin the pressure he needs to pull out of the Ukraine.</p>
<p>"Right", Xi will say, "but you will not stand in my way when we reunite with Taiwan."</p>
<p>I guess Trump does see that Taiwan rejoining China might disrupt the semiconductor industry, but he has no stake in any historic sensitivities and he clearly couldn't give a damn about democracy. He might just say "ok".
In fact I wouldn't be surprised if Xi had just been holding off on the Taiwan issue because he was waiting for the opportunity to play Trump.</p>
<p>And Europe will just stand by and watch.</p>
